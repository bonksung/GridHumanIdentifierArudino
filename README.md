# GridHumanIdentifierArudino
Grid Identification for Arduino Platform / Support for #ATC2017 #ImmersiveHall

This project is a support machine for <The Way You Walk (2017)> by, Koo Bon Seong(Art&Technology, Sogang University), Lim Bo Mi(Art&Technology, Sogang University).

## Purpose
We are doing this Arduino project to identify human in the space in terms of N X N grid.
Our project is tested on Immersive Hall(Sogang University, Xavier Hall, 5th floor).
This project makes available to identify human (or humans) in a space, and get coordinates of each identified people.
This project also help to find the differenciate of the coordinates and to calculate the moving distance or time.
